# Screen libraray in python
*A simple customizable CMD for python. The current source code is very very messy and I am only releasing a compiled version of the program.*

*I will release a 2.0 version with full customization at some point next year(2022) and that will contain the source code for both.*

## **Known bugs:**

#### *the time and screen will only update when an ask, say or clear is called.*

## **DOCS**:

### How to install:
Put the .pyc file into the same folder as your project and simply import it.

### Print Hello, world
```
import screen
screen.say("Hello, world")
```

### Get user input
```
import screen
name = screen.ask("What is your name> ")
```

### Clear the screen
```
import screen
screen.clear()
```

### Quit
```
import screen
screen.quit()
```
